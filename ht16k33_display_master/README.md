HT16K33 with 2x 3 digit 7-segment display and combined with DS18B20 temperature sensor.

Here is my circuit on breadboard with ch32v003f4p6 breakout and ht16k33 breakouts. 
Neopixel not used in this example. 
I used two 2.2k pullup resistors for i2c lines PC1 and PC2. Display connection is based on Adafruit's schematic. I extended display size 4 to 6.
